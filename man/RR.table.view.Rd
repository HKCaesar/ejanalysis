\title{Print Relative Risks (RR) info by demog group by risk type by zone}
\usage{
RR.table.view(RRS, d, e, zone)
}
\arguments{
\item{RRS}{A three dimensional array that is created by \code{\link{RR}} and has format like RRS[d, e, zone]}

\item{d}{Vector of names of demographic groups that must be subset of first dimension of RRS}

\item{e}{Vector of names of environmental risk indicators that must be subset of second dimension of RRS}

\item{zone}{Vector of zone names that must be subset of names of third dimension of RRS}
}
\value{
prints RRS[d, e, zone]
}
\description{
Takes zone-specific RRS values and prints them for viewing.
}
